Question 1: Are there any ARP requests to which you should not answer?
Question 2: When does a IP-to-MAC mapping entry changes? Should you alert of such a case?

Answer 1:
If too many (above some defined threshold, for example default 1000 unanswered queries with an average rate of 50 or more per minute)
ARP requests destined for a node that is not answering thr Proxy ARP should stop replying.

Answer 2:
The IP-to-MAC mapping could change either if the IP is changed for a given MAC or if a MAC changes and we want the IP to be preserved.
when a node goes down and up in an interval larger than the DHCP lease time,
it is reasonable that the same host(MAC) will end up with a different IP address than it held before.
another situation would be setting a static IP address which is different that was was assigned prior to the change.
The MAC address of course is a permanent vendor driven address, however, in case a NIC is replaced on a server, it will surly have
a different MAC address even though we might want the server to have the same IP address.
another situation that might cause the same behavior is using the "bonding" module, which is essentially a logic interface
riding on two physical NICS, this module uses the feature of "floating MAC" and in case NIC1 is the master now,
the IP assigned for the server would consist the MAC of the "floating MAC" at the moment, changing the active NIC to be the
slave one, changes the floating MAC" and the logic device will use the slave's MAC with the sane IP assigned for this server and the
master NIC.
