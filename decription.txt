Pox - ARP-Storm:

./graphs/ -
    Contains two graphs for the comparison of the number of arp msgs before and after implementing
    the answering arp msg in the controller.

./pcap/ -
    Contains the pcap and  ps files that represent the packet flowing in all hosts
    after implementing the learning switch and the arp msgs responder.

./project_answers/ -
   Contains the answers for the questions asked in the Mininet project.

./of_learning_switch.py -
    The code implementing the controller port mapping by hosts mac.
    We added a dictionary mac_port_mapping and update it in every packet that sent in the network,
    if we know the port of the destination host (by MAC) we install a flow for the packet transfer only for to
    the specific host, otherwise we flood the packet to all ports.

    Main functions:
        _handle_PacketIn (self, event) - Handles packet in messages from the switch.
        act_like_switch (self, packet, packet_in) - Implement switch-like behavior, learn MAC addresses of peer devices.
        install_rule(self, out_port, packet_in, packet) - Installing a flow entry.
        resend_packet(self, packet_in, out_port) - Resend a packet, this time with a new outgoing port on switch.

./of_learning_switch_answer_arps.py -
    The code implementing the controller IP to MAC mapping and the special ARP packet handling.
    for each packet arrived to the switch we check if it's an ARP msg type then we update the ip_mac_mapping dictionary,
    in case it was an ARP-Request and we have a match for the requested MAC in our mapping then construct
    a new ARP-Replay msg if and sent it back to the ARP-Request sender, otherwise act like a switch.

    Main functions:
        - All the main functions of of_learning_switch.py.
        handle_arp(self, event, packet, packet_in) - Constructs an appropriate ARP Reply upon an incoming ARP Request.
        construct_arp_reply(self, arp_request) - Create an ARP Reply message.
